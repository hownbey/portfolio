# Harrison Ownbey's writing portfolio

Hi! I'm [Harrison Ownbey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonownbey/). I'm a versatile, team-oriented technical writer with over a decade of experience at three Fortune 500 companies and a proven record of driving business results.

## Before-and-after designs

Sometimes the best way to see how far you've come is to look where you started. Check out the following before-and-after content designs:

* Redesigned a [page on PayPal Developer that gets over a million visits a year](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/get-started-redesign.md).
* Rewrote an [API overview that increased customer adoption](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/api-rewrite.md).

## Customer research

I conducted user interviews and passed key takeaways to executives in an [easy-to-read blog](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/customer-interview-writeup.md).

## UI writing

In a perfect world, the UI is so intuitive that users don't need documentation. See my attempt at chasing the dream with my [Developer Dashboard UI text audit](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/ui-audit.md).

## The mess behind the magic

This brief writeup is an inside look at how I took confusing requirements from a product manager and created [one easy-to-read sentence](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/one-sentence.md).

## For non-developers

This process doc tells anyone who contributes to documentation how to troubleshoot if a [code block change makes the page 404](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/code-block-troubleshooting.md).

## Old-school hardware documentation

Remember when you'd buy hardware and the guide came in the box? I've written those guides. [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l9dnbc7sdddg3cnype8ph/9033_GSG.pdf?rlkey=nuqa5cclok00js70i0cnu9anh&dl=0).
