# Harrison Ownbey's writing portfolio

Hi! I'm Harrison Ownbey. I'm a versatile, team-oriented technical writer with over a decade of experience at Fortune 500 companies and a proven record of driving business results.

## Before-and-after designs

Sometimes the best way to see how far you've come is to look where you started. Check out the following before-and-after content designs: 

* Redesigned a [page on PayPal Developer that gets over a million visits a year](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/get-started-redesign.md).
* Rewrote an [API overview that increased customer adoption](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/api-rewrite.md).

## Customer research

I conducted user interviews and passed key takeaways to executives in an [easy-to-read blog format](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/customer-interview-writeup.md). 

## UI writing 

Check out my [Developer Dashboard UI text audit](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/ui-audit.md).

## The mess behind the magic 

This brief writeup is an inside look at how I took confusing requirements from a PM and created [one easy-to-read sentence](https://github.com/hownbey/portfolio/blob/main/one-sentence.md).
