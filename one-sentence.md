# The problem

A sentence at the top of an API call log read as follows:
> "This view is limited to a maximum of 100 recent API Calls within the last 15 days only."

It was a clunky sentence. Worse, it was an inaccurate sentence since engineering added new functionality to the call log.

## The prompt from a PM

Here’s what the product manager requested in the ticket. Can’t help but love PM language:
> “I want to emphasize that this applies to the sort and search actions too - such that number of results will never be greater than X, where X =  100 OR the X < 100 results available within last 15 days. I also need to get it corrected for conciseness of language and grammar check”

## The result

I reworked the sentence like this:
> “View, sort and search up to 100 calls made within the last 15 days.”

I took the PM’s requirements and wrote a sentence that was shorter, clearer, and contained more information. The PM approved it with a little smiley emoji, which surprised me because this PM doesn’t smile much.

When the new API call log went live, customer feedback scores for the page increased by 10%. Most of the bump was due to the new search functionality, but I was happy to create content that helped customers and then got out of their way. 

## Why is one sentence in my portfolio?

I’ve often found that the way someone does one thing is a good indicator of how they do everything. This example is a microcosm of how I work. I take beat-up source material and confusing requirements and I make something good. It’s deceptively simple.
