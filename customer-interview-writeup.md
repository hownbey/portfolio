The following is a writeup of findings from customer interviews. I published this writeup on an internal blog to pass key takeaways to executives.

# PayPal Champions on documentation

We recently interviewed two bona-fide PayPal Champions about our documentation. This post covers:
* Project background
* Customer profiles
* Key takeaways

## What is a PayPal Champion?

[PayPal Champions](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/community/paypalchampions/) are a select few developers who go above and beyond to advocate for PayPal. They're thought leaders in the developer community who've analyzed the ecommerce market thoroughly. Theyâ€™ve decided PayPal is the best fit for their customers. In many cases, they're CEOs and founders of small businesses that help merchants solve specific problems.

## Methodology

I decided the documentation itself is a product, so I opted to have an open-ended discussion about the developer portal. This was the right approach - using Champions as generic testers would have lost the nuance of their perspectives as Champions.

Before I interviewed our guests of honor, I prepared a discussion guide with help from our user research group. The discussion guide kept us on track and ensures that other team members can conduct future interviews in a similar way. We can't wait to do this again with other champs.

Ok, on to the findings!

## Champion 1

Champion 1 is the CEO of a service that builds dashboards for PayPal and Stripe integrations focusing on subscription-based businesses. Champion 1 looks exclusively at the REST API reference - no SDK docs. He's so familiar with REST integrations that he doesn't use our integration guides. He accesses our documentation by Googling "PayPal REST APIs" and usually lands on the /api/rest homepage. He uses the left-hand nav to find the API he needs and dives right into the reference.

### Top Insights from Champion 1

* He likes the overall look and feel of the API reference.
* **We should include changelogs or release notes of what changed in each release of the API**.
* **We should include API limitations in the general description of the API.** Currently, he has to dig through the API reference to find the API's limitations, which can be time-consuming and inconsistent across APIs.

## Champion 2

Champion 2 began building ecommerce websites in 2000, right when the PayPal button came out. He's been working with PayPal ever since as the CEO of a small business. Developers often call Champion 2 when they don't know which PayPal integration to pick. Champion 2 uses the entire developer portal and has become familiar with a wide array of PayPal products as he's used many throughout the years.

### Top Insights from Champion 2

* People don't know where to start with PayPal products, but once they find the right integration, they usually don't have much trouble implementing it.
* PayPal integration guides have significantly improved over the past year.
* A confused mind says no. People are more amenable to integrating a product if they understand exactly what they're getting.
* **It's too easy to get lost inside PayPal Developer's information architecture.**
* **There needs to be more clarity in differentiating our REST APIs.**
* **Including error codes and troubleshooting info would be excellent value-adds for our API reference.** Our NVP/SOAP reference had this feature, but our REST reference no longer does.
