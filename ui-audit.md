# Developer Dashboard UI audit

I audited UI copy in the PayPal Developer Dashboard to improve scannability and reduce time-to-click. Below are examples of how I tightened text and pointed users to to related documentation for deep learning.

| Original text | Update | Comments |
| :------------ | :----- | :------- |
| Get started by clicking **Create App**. PayPal Commerce Platform for Business users can get started quickly by using the **Default Application** credentials to test PayPal REST APIs in our sandbox. | Replaced text with two buttons: **Create App** and **Create Sandbox Credentials** | The original text combines UI labeling and how-to content. I removed the how-to content. A user sees their credentials when they select the button and can read how-to content there. |
| To access these apps, use the Live toggle to leave the testing environment | Use the **Live** toggle to see NVP/SOAP apps. | Streamlined the phrase into a simple sentence. |
| Test your PayPal Express Checkout integration in the sandbox using the Braintree SDK. When you're ready to go live, see [Go live]. | Test your Express Checkout with a sandbox Braintree SDK integration. | Removed "Go live" text. The docs will guide the user there - no need to do it in the dashboard. |
| Note: You can link a maximum of five Braintree SDK sandbox access tokens to your PayPal account. | Link up to 5 Braintree access tokens to a PayPal account. | Hid text behind a little question mark that users can click for more info. The dashboard should be a hands-on experience with minimal reading. Also no need for it to be a "note" |
| Note that not all features are available for live transactions. Features available for live transactions are listed in your [account eligibility]. | See available features in [account eligiblity]. | Reduced wording and let the content inside the link do the heavy lifting. |
| Identity service that enables your customers to log in with their PayPal account. | Help customers log in with their PayPal account. | Tightened the wording. Every letter matters in UI copy. |
| You cannot generate Braintree SDK sandbox access tokens because you do not have a sandbox Business account in a supported country. To generate a Braintree SDK sandbox access token, create a sandbox Business account in one of the following countries: ...... | Country not supported. Create a sandbox business account in a [supported country]. | Rewrote to avoid blaming the user. Also the entire country availablity list was in a tiny box. I linked out to the list. |
| Review sandbox email notifications as a result of REST and Classic API requests and responses. Only notifications from the last 30 days will be displayed. | Sandbox API emails are available for 30 days only. | This is informational copy so I tightened it and removed the CTA. |
| After you configure a listener, you can use the Webhooks simulator with a sample payload to simulate mock webhook events. The simulator validates that your listener can successfully receive event data without any connectivity issues and generates mock event data to show you how webhook events look. |Test your listener with mock webhook events. [Learn more]. | The original copy is documentation hiding in the UI. Tightened to a very brief command and then linked out to a page that covers the nuances of webhook testing. |
